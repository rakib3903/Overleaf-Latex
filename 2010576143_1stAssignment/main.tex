\subsection{First year experience}
I was so excited in the first day of my academic class. I can not explain my feelings in words in that day. In that day I had an oriented class. So in the morning of the day I got ready for going to oriented class. After reaching our Academic building, I was excited. Our academic building is so much beautiful. Our department is located northern block of the building. As I was new I did not know where our oriented class would be held. So I asked in office about it. Then I could know that our oriented class would be held on third floor 318 no. room. After reaching on third floor, I saw my class mates stood on the portico. I went there and met with them. when it was 9 : 30 am ,then we enter for the first time in our class room.  The room was well-decorated. we gave and took our indentities with one another. After sometimes our teachers came into the room and welcome us with roses. They talk with us. From this day first year first semester class started. I attended class regularly.
