\section{Conclusion}
A natural human robot interaction system has been implemented and  and designed in an experimental environment with good performance. A user can interact and control two robotic arms by using his/her  hands in the same workspace. There is always more room for innovation in any study. During this
project, I came across many modern innovative automation techniques
todayâ€™s world has developed. If given a chance to do this project again, I am
very much interested in applying those techniques. One such technique is
application of robotic arm. A robotic arm is artificial version of human
muscle. Not only this, many other techniques are applicable for this kind of
machine. The machine gets upgraded into a super
machine with ultimate application of automation.
