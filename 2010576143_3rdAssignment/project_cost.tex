\section{Project cost}
The cost of a robotic arms project will depend on several factors, including:\\
1. The complexity of the design and requirements for the robotic arm\\
2. The materials and components used in the construction of the robotic arm\\
3. The development and testing costs for the control system\\
4. The costs for integrating the control system with other systems\\
5. The costs for installing and deploying the robotic arm in the industrial environment\\
6. The costs for training the operators and maintenance personnel\\
7. The ongoing costs for maintenance and upgrades \\
